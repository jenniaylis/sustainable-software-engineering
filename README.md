## CONCERNS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 🌱

The CEO of Microsoft once stated that every company is a software company. It is true because information technology affects us all, regardless of the field. Information technology, or as its also known as IT, has changed our society in numerous ways over the past few decades. At the same time, it has become a significant contributor to the rapidly growing carbon footprint.

To begin with, the material used to manufacture electronical devices has encouraged mining industry to expand its production, and as a result, carbon emissions have soared 📈 The mining industry affects local ecosystems radically. It is destroying the biodiversity and endangering certain animal species that are dependent on these unique ecosystems 🐾 Another major issue with current technologies is the expansive collection of data acquisition on different platforms. Data processing does not come without its costs for the environment: for example, [the cryptocurrency Bitcoin uses the same amount of electricity annually as the Norwegian state](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/) 🇳🇴! Similarly, an enormous amount of energy is consumed by various streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, as well as various [algorithms](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/why-should-sustainability-be-a-first-class-consideration-for-ai-systems) using artificial intelligence for advertising purposes.

Often, when talking about the sustainable development of information technology, the focus is almost exclusively on climate effects. IT also threatens social sustainability in many ways. The official definition of social sustainability includes e.g. safety, equality, an individual’s opportunity to influence one’s own life, and communality.

One threat to social sustainability is media influence in forms of misinformation for example the spread of fake news, conspiracy theories and internet-trolls, which ultimately polarizes societies. This is already reflected in current politics in several countries where various populist parties have come to power. Internet discussions are often either black or white, and there is no longer urge to understand dissenters. What will happen to democracy and diplomacy in the future?

Today, internet knows us better than anyone else. Besides knowing us by name the applications collect location information, contact information and financial information about us. The internet discovers our interests. This is how the internet threatens an individual’s privacy. Privacy creates security. Are we sure we are safe?

The internet has enabled fast and continuous communication between people but at the same time it isolates people from one another. Loneliness is again one problem of social sustainability. Social media 📱 and video games 🎮 can cause addiction, leaving no time for anything else. Also, constant self-comparison with others on social media can cause depression and eating disorders 😞. What about working remote, does it increase loneliness?

[A third of world’s population still live without internet access](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/30/more-than-a-third-of-worlds-population-has-never-used-the-internet-says-un). Most of them live in slums and poor rural villages. The use of internet in these regions would facilitate education and getting jobs. The lack of internet therefore increases inequality in the world. Another perspective is gender inequality 🚻 [Men make technology for men](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/research/spotlight-research/are-new-technologies-men-only). For example, the speech recognition applications usually work better on men than on women. Virtual Reality glasses are usually too heavy or too loose for women’s heads. Male applicants clearly outnumber female applicants in IT. Men are paid more than women for the same engineering work 🤑 Fortunately, attention has recently shifted to resolve these gender inequalities.

Although IT sector has its downsides in terms of sustainable development, the IT sector also offers new solutions and fresh opportunities. Information technology is a powerful tool that can truly change the world. Whether the world will change for the better or for the worse – it is up to current generation 🌎♻️💚


I want to make this world a better place if I just can :sparkles:
